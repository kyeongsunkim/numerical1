Strain—Softening Stiffness—Hardening Model by Sakai and Tanaka, 1993 2. Typical Mohr-Coulomb with Non-associated Flow 3. Extended Mohr-Coulomb Model by David Muir Wood, 2004 1.1 Strain—Softening Stiffness—Hardening Model It is assumed that the yield function \\(F\\) is defined by the stress \\(\\vec{\\sigma}\\) and the soil parameter \\(\\chi\\) (Tanaka and Sakai, 1993): \\(F(\\vec{\\sigma},\\alpha(\\chi))=0\\) In order to avoid numerical instability due to singularity of the non-associated Mohr-Coulomb model, a constitutive model based on the yield function of M-C type and the plastic potential function of Draker-Prager type is employed. For predicting deformations in a post-peak regime, the elastic- strain-softening plastic model is developed. The yield function is given by the following expression. 1.1.1 Yield function \\[ F(\\vec{\\sigma},\\alpha(\\chi)) = 3\\alpha(\\chi)p&#39;+\\frac{\\sqrt{J_2}}{g(\\theta)}-c(\\chi) = 0 \\] 1.1.2 Plastic potential function \\[ G(\\vec{\\sigma},\\alpha&#39;(\\chi)) = 3\\alpha^{&#39;}(\\chi)p&#39;+\\sqrt{J_2}-c(\\chi) = 0 \\] \\[ \\chi = \\int \\delta\\varepsilon^{p} \\] \\[ (\\delta\\varepsilon^{p})^2 = 2[(\\delta\\epsilon_x^{p})^2+(\\delta\\epsilon_y^{p})^2+(\\delta\\epsilon_z^{p})^2+]+(\\delta\\gamma^{p})^2 \\] , where \\(p^{&#39;}\\) is mean stress, \\(J_2\\) is second invariant of deviatoric stress, \\(\\chi\\) is soil hardening parameter, \\(c(\\chi)\\) is apparent cohesion function, \\(\\delta \\varepsilon_{x,y,z}^{p} , \\delta \\gamma^{p}\\) is incremental deviatoric plastic strains. In case of the Mohr-Coulomb model, \\(g(\\theta)\\) is given by: \\[ g(\\theta) = \\frac{3-sin\\phi}{2\\sqrt{3}cos\\theta -2sin\\theta sin\\phi} \\] , where \\(\\theta\\) is Lode angle; if triaxial compression, \\(=-30 ^{\\circ}\\) \\(\\phi\\) is mobilized internal friction angle. 1.1.3 Hardening function The simple strain-softening functions are specified and expressed as a function of material constants. (Tanaka and Sakai, 1993) \\[ \\alpha(\\chi) = {(\\frac{2\\sqrt{a\\chi }}{\\chi +a})}^m \\alpha_p\\; \\\\ (hardening \\; regime;\\; \\chi \\leq a) \\] \\[ \\alpha(\\chi) = \\alpha_r + (\\alpha_p - \\alpha_r) exp\\{-(\\frac{\\chi-a}{b})\\}\\; \\\\ (softening \\; regime;\\; \\chi &gt; a) \\] , where \\(a, b, m\\) are soil parameters. Similar expressions are used by de Borst (1986). \\[ \\alpha_p = \\frac{2 sin \\phi_p}{\\sqrt{3}(3-sin\\phi_p)} \\] \\[ \\alpha_r = \\frac{2 sin \\phi_r}{\\sqrt{3}(3-sin\\phi_r)} \\] , where \\(\\phi_{p,r}\\) are peak and residual friction angle, respectively. 1.2 Nonassociated Flow Rule (NA) Since there may be a range of possible solutions, each associated with a different pattern of localization and all of which are entirely valid, it can be expected that any numerical solution will be very sensitive to both physical imperfections as well as round-off errors and the exact sequence in which the procedures defining the solution scheme are carried out. In the end, the result is a load-displacement response that tends to be rather oscillatory. Figure 1.1: Load-displacement response for strip footing on a weightless soil (After Krabbenhoft et al., 2012) The basic idea behind the formulation derives from the structure of the internal dissipation associated with constitutive models. Let us assume a yield function of the type: \\[ F = Mp+q-c \\] , where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are mean and deviatoric stress, \\(M\\) is a friction coeffcieint, and \\(c\\) is cohesion. The plastic potential function is given by: \\[ G = Np +q \\] , where \\(N \\leq M\\) is a dilation coefficient. In \\(p-q\\) triaxial space, the plastic strain rates are given by: \\[ \\delta \\varepsilon_v^{p} = \\delta \\lambda \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p} = \\delta \\lambda N \\\\ \\delta \\varepsilon_s^{p} = \\delta \\lambda \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p} = \\delta \\lambda \\] , where \\(\\delta\\) denotes time increment, \\(\\varepsilon_v^{p}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_s^{p}\\) are volumetic and deviatoric plastic strains conjugate to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), respectively. The dissipation \\(D\\) is given by: \\(\\begin{aligned} D &amp;= p \\varepsilon_v^{p} + q \\varepsilon_s^{p} \\\\ &amp;= (Nq+q) \\delta \\lambda \\\\ &amp;= [c-(M-N)p]\\delta \\lambda \\\\ &amp;= [c - (M-N)p]\\varepsilon_s^{p} \\end{aligned}\\) The above-mentioned parameters are all related with the confining pressure, which can be easily illustraed with the figure below: Figure 1.2: Microscopic origins of friction as plastic shearing of asperities. A higher confining pressure implies a higher degree of interlocking of the asperities and thereby a higher apparent shear strength (After Krabbenhoft et al., 2012) 1.3 Extended Mohr—Coulomb Model (EMC) The elastic-perfectly plastic Mohr-Coulomb model is widely used for geotechnical analysis. It provides very crude match to actual shearing behavior of soils. A natural extension is to create a hardening version of the M-C model in which the size of the yield surface varies in some nonlinear way with the development of plastic strain. In the model to be described as hardening will be linked only with distortional strain. It is useful for modelling sands , where it is rearrangement of the rather particles that dominates the response and irrecoverable volumetric changes are essentially linked by this rearrangement of particles (Wood, 2004). Figure 1.3: Plastic potential curves (solid lines) and yield loci (dashed lines) in elastic-hardening plastic Mohr-Coulomb modele Following Taylor’s (1948) proposal of a link between dilatancy and mobilized friction in a shear box test, stress—dilatancy equation expressed in terms of total strain increments is obtained. Figure 1.4: Hardening, compaction and dilation in the HMC model 1.3.1 Comparison between associated and non-associated flow rule in plastic model In the elastic-perfectly-plastic Mohr-Coulomb model, it is commonly assumed that the plastic potential takes the same form as the yield surface, but with the slope defined by a dilation angle \\(\\psi\\) rather than a friction angle. If this assumption is adopted, then the dirction of the plastic strain increment \\(\\delta \\varepsilon^{p}\\) would be normal to a set of parallel lines by the dilation angle. If normality rule were assumed, radical difference between the slope of yield criterion line and the plastic potental contour is observed (J.P. Doherty and D. Muir Wood, 2013).

Critical State description is as follows: \\(M&#39; = M - k [(v_0 - \\Gamma + \\lambda ln p_0&#39; + (\\lambda ln \\frac{p&#39;}{p_0&#39;}-v_0 \\varepsilon_p^e)-v_0\\varepsilon_p^p)]\\). 1.3.4 Flow rule \\[ \\frac{\\delta \\varepsilon_{p}^{p}}{\\delta \\varepsilon_{q}^{p}} = M -M&#39;- \\eta_y \\] 1.3.5 Hardening \\[ \\delta \\eta_y = \\frac{1-\\frac{\\eta_y}{M}}{\\beta} \\delta \\varepsilon_q^p \\] , where \\(\\beta\\) is a model parameter scaling plastic strain, \\(\\beta = \\frac{3}{2}p&#39; \\frac{9-M}{9-(M-M&#39;)M ln2 - 3M&#39;} \\frac{1-E_{50}/E_{ur}}{E_{50}}\\) for Taylor’s \\(\\sigma-\\psi\\) relation. The incremental of the stress ratio is defined as: \\(\\delta \\eta_y = \\frac{3 sin \\delta \\phi}{\\sqrt{3}cos\\theta+sin\\theta sin\\delta\\phi}\\) 1.3.6 Soil Parameters 1.3.6.1 Elastic Moduli The elastic moduli are estimated from the modified equation proposed by Hardin and Black (1968) in the case of sand: \\[ G = G_0 \\frac{(2.17-e)^2}{1+e}\\sqrt{p&#39;} \\\\ K = \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-2 \\nu)}G \\] , where \\(\\nu\\) is Poisson’s ratio, \\(e\\) is void ratio, \\(G_0\\) is initial shear modulus. 1.3.6.2 Peak friction angle The peak friction angle of \\(\\phi_p\\) is estimated from the empirical relations proposed by Bolton (1987): \\[ I_r = D_r[5-ln(\\frac{p&#39;}{150})]-1, \\; (p&#39; \\geq 150 kN/m^2) \\\\ I_r = 5D_r -1 , \\; (p&#39; &lt; 150 kN/m^2) \\\\ \\phi_p = 3I_r + \\phi_r \\] 1.3.6.3 Dilatency angle The dilatency angle of \\(\\psi\\) is estimated from modified Rowe’s stress–dilatency relationship: \\[ sin\\psi = \\frac{sin\\phi-sin\\phi_r&#39;}{1-sin\\phi sin\\phi_r&#39;} \\\\ \\phi_r&#39; = \\phi_r[1-\\beta exp\\{-(\\frac{\\chi}{\\epsilon_d})^2\\}] \\] , where \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\epsilon_d\\) are stress—dilatency material parameters. \\(E_{50}\\) is a secant modulus defined as: \\(E_{50} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}q_{u}}{\\varepsilon_{a,50}}\\) \\(E_{ur}\\) is unloading/reloading stiffness.

The set up is as follows: 2.1 Drained Triaxial Test Figure 2.1: Typical triaxial test (After Krabbenhoft, 2013) Figure 2.2: Typical shear-volumetric strain behavior in triaxial compression (After Krabbenhoft, 2013) Two tests — Triaxial compression and extension (TC/TE) — are simulated using Multiplier Elasto—plastic analysis under axisymmetric conditions as indicated in the Figure below. The fixed loads here represent the initial axial and radial stresses while the axial Multiplier load is increased in the course of the analysis to reach the ultimate limit state. Figure 2.3: Setup for elemental triaxial compression and extension By a process of trial and error, the fits shown in Figure are obtained. For this data set , where no information about the behavior in simple shear is available the value is well within range that can be accommodated by the isotropic strength option, there is little reason to assume any anisotropy. We note that the compression secant modulus in compression is only half of the extension secant modulus. This is somewhat unusual, but in this case nevertheless what fits the data best. 2.1.0.1 Result of Elemental Triaxial Test at 100 kPa Triaxial test at radial stress of 100 kPa is simulated using one by one block of the finite elmeent formulation with the EMC model.

The goal of the mesh convergence test usually is to seek the acceptable range of number of the mesh size. However, the interest in the present paper differs from the previously investigated objectives, in a way that the object sought is not the same. The present paper seeks to draw a more detailed analysis of the failure surface formed as the soil is sheared. Some authors in the past described this with the width of the shear band (Tanaka and Sakai, 1993). However, the present paper deals only with the limit analysis formulation using the Extended Mohr-Coulomb model. 2.3.1.1 Mesh Convergence Results The reulst of the present investigation is the determination of the number of the mesh elements be around 2000. However, it is noted that further studies, outside of this paper, is onto the maximum number of the elements to be studied, for this will enhance the visualization of the shear band formation, as well as the guidance onto the study of the shear dissipation. Figure 2.6: Typical result from mesh convergence test (maximum number of elements) Figure 2.7: Result of the mesh convergence test, which confirms that about 2000 elements are acceptable Figure 2.8: Shear Dissipation of the mesh convergence test of 250, 500, 2000 elements Figure 2.9: Mesh of 250, 500, 2000 elements Figure 2.10: Shear Dissipation of the mesh convergence test of 5000, 10000, 20000 elements Figure 2.11: Mesh of 5000, 10000, 20000 elements 2.3.2 Boundary Convergence The soil tank width and the distance below the anchor to the soil tank boundary are the primary condern for the modeling. Therefore, the optimized value of the soil tank width has been investigated, by differing the values from 10B to 3B, , wherein B refers to the width of the anchor plate. Figure 2.12: Convergence test setup on different boundary size: (a) 10B, (b) 7B, (c) 5B, (d) 3B Due to the reasoning which considers the method of mesh adaptivity, insignificant effect onto the extension of the soil tank width has been deemed acceptable by the author. Therefore, the result of the boundary convergence test is determined at 10B.

In order to find the suitable pair of a set of variables, the values were varied by interpolating those in between the dense and the loose sands of the representative values from the example file provided by the software. The result is that for the EMC model, the set named B and C show a good match, whereas for the NA model, the set with H and G display a favorable fit. The chosen set of parameters are presented in the tables below: The table below show the KAIST centrifuge test set-up and the results. The table 4.4 shows the numerical test set-up, mainly for the dimensions corresponding the formulated in-house codes. Figure 4.2: Typical mesh of the numerical simulation; number of mesh = 5000 While the mesh convergence test on the plate anchor pull-out test showed that the number of mesh around 2000 are reasonable, the final mesh number was chosen to be 5000 for more detailed representation of the shear dissipation bands in the graphics.

The data from total number of 80 simulations were accumulated to draw 8 plots with base numbers from 2 to 8, which represent the variation of the size of the footing width. In the plot below, the line with markers represent the NA model, whereas only those of the colored lines are the EMC models. It is noted that among 80 load—displacement curves, only 4 were selected for matching the dense and loose sand cases of the centrifuge test results.
