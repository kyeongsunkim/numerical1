% John commented this file extensively, so read through to see how to use the various options.  Remember that in LaTeX,
% any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one formats for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{templates/ociamthesis}
% This one formats for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one formats for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

% As you can see from the uncommented line below, oxforddown template uses the a4paper size, 
% and passes in the binding option from the YAML header in index.Rmd:
\documentclass[a4paper, nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

\newpage

\noindent Here is a brief description of the constitutive models:\\

2. Typical Mohr-Coulomb with Non-associated Flow\\
3. Extended Mohr-Coulomb Model by David Muir Wood, 2004

\hypertarget{strainsoftening-stiffnesshardening-model}{%
\section{Strain---Softening Stiffness---Hardening Model}\label{strainsoftening-stiffnesshardening-model}}

It is assumed that the yield function \(F\) is defined by the stress \(\vec{\sigma}\) and the soil parameter \(\chi\) (Tanaka and Sakai, 1993):\\
\(F(\vec{\sigma},\alpha(\chi))=0\)

In order to avoid numerical instability due to singularity of the non-associated Mohr-Coulomb model, a constitutive model based on the yield function of M-C type and the plastic potential function of Draker-Prager type is employed.

For predicting deformations in a post-peak regime, the elastic- strain-softening plastic model is developed. The yield function is given by the following expression.

\hypertarget{yield-function}{%
\subsection{Yield function}\label{yield-function}}

\[
  F(\vec{\sigma},\alpha(\chi)) = 3\alpha(\chi)p'+\frac{\sqrt{J_2}}{g(\theta)}-c(\chi) = 0
\]

\hypertarget{plastic-potential-function}{%
\subsection{Plastic potential function}\label{plastic-potential-function}}

\[
  G(\vec{\sigma},\alpha'(\chi)) = 3\alpha^{'}(\chi)p'+\sqrt{J_2}-c(\chi) = 0
\]

\[
  \chi = \int \delta\varepsilon^{p}
\]

\[
  (\delta\varepsilon^{p})^2 = 2[(\delta\epsilon_x^{p})^2+(\delta\epsilon_y^{p})^2+(\delta\epsilon_z^{p})^2+]+(\delta\gamma^{p})^2
\]
, where\\
\(p^{'}\) is mean stress,\\
\(J_2\) is second invariant of deviatoric stress,\\
\(\chi\) is soil hardening parameter,\\
\(c(\chi)\) is apparent cohesion function,\\
\(\delta \varepsilon_{x,y,z}^{p} , \delta \gamma^{p}\) is incremental deviatoric plastic strains.

In case of the Mohr-Coulomb model, \(g(\theta)\) is given by:

\[
  g(\theta) = \frac{3-sin\phi}{2\sqrt{3}cos\theta -2sin\theta sin\phi}
\]
, where\\
\(\theta\) is Lode angle; if triaxial compression, \(=-30 ^{\circ}\)\\
\(\phi\) is mobilized internal friction angle.

\hypertarget{hardening-function}{%
\subsection{Hardening function}\label{hardening-function}}

The simple strain-softening functions are specified and expressed as a function of material constants. (Tanaka and Sakai, 1993)

\[
\alpha(\chi) = {(\frac{2\sqrt{a\chi }}{\chi +a})}^m \alpha_p\; \\ (hardening \; regime;\; \chi \leq a) 
\]

\[
\alpha(\chi) = \alpha_r + (\alpha_p - \alpha_r) exp\{-(\frac{\chi-a}{b})\}\; \\ (softening \; regime;\; \chi > a) 
\]
, where\\
\(a, b, m\) are soil parameters.

Similar expressions are used by de Borst (1986).

\[
\alpha_p = \frac{2 sin \phi_p}{\sqrt{3}(3-sin\phi_p)}
\]

\[
\alpha_r = \frac{2 sin \phi_r}{\sqrt{3}(3-sin\phi_r)}
\]
, where\\
\(\phi_{p,r}\) are peak and residual friction angle, respectively.

\hypertarget{nonassociated-flow-rule-na}{%
\section{Nonassociated Flow Rule (NA)}\label{nonassociated-flow-rule-na}}

Since there may be a range of possible solutions, each associated with a different pattern of localization and all of which are entirely valid, it can be expected that any numerical solution will be very sensitive to both physical imperfections as well as round-off errors and the exact sequence in which the procedures defining the solution scheme are carried out. In the end, the result is a load-displacement response that tends to be rather oscillatory.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{myfigureeeeee/Load-displacement response for strip footing on a weightless soil} \caption{Load-displacement response for strip footing on a weightless soil (After  Krabbenhoft et al., 2012)}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

The basic idea behind the formulation derives from the structure of the internal dissipation associated with constitutive models. Let us assume a yield function of the type:

\[
F = Mp+q-c
\]
, where\\
\(p\) and \(q\) are mean and deviatoric stress, \(M\) is a friction coeffcieint, and \(c\) is cohesion.

The plastic potential function is given by:\\
\[
G = Np +q
\]
, where \(N \leq M\) is a dilation coefficient.

In \(p-q\) triaxial space, the plastic strain rates are given by:

\[
\delta \varepsilon_v^{p} = \delta \lambda \frac{\partial G}{\partial p} = \delta \lambda N \\
\delta \varepsilon_s^{p} = \delta \lambda \frac{\partial G}{\partial p} = \delta \lambda
\]
, where
\(\delta\) denotes time increment, \(\varepsilon_v^{p}\) and \(\varepsilon_s^{p}\) are volumetic and deviatoric plastic strains conjugate to \(p\) and \(q\), respectively.

The dissipation \(D\) is given by:

\(\begin{aligned} D &= p \varepsilon_v^{p} + q \varepsilon_s^{p} \\  &= (Nq+q) \delta \lambda \\  &= [c-(M-N)p]\delta \lambda \\  &= [c - (M-N)p]\varepsilon_s^{p} \end{aligned}\)

The above-mentioned parameters are all related with the confining pressure, which can be easily illustraed with the figure below:

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{myfigureeeeee/confiningpressure} \caption{Microscopic origins of friction as plastic shearing of asperities. A higher confining pressure implies a higher degree of interlocking of the asperities and thereby a higher apparent shear strength (After  Krabbenhoft et al., 2012)}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{extended-mohrcoulomb-model-emc}{%
\section{Extended Mohr---Coulomb Model (EMC)}\label{extended-mohrcoulomb-model-emc}}

The elastic-perfectly plastic Mohr-Coulomb model is widely used for geotechnical analysis. It provides very crude match to actual shearing behavior of soils. A natural extension is to create a hardening version of the M-C model in which the size of the yield surface varies in some nonlinear way with the development of plastic strain. In the model to be described as hardening will be linked only with distortional strain. It is useful for modelling sands , where it is rearrangement of the rather particles that dominates the response and irrecoverable volumetric changes are essentially linked by this rearrangement of particles (Wood, 2004).

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{myfigureeeeee/Plastic potential curves (solid lines) and yield loci (dashed lines) in elastic-hardening plastic Mohr-Coulomb model} \caption{Plastic potential curves (solid lines) and yield loci (dashed lines) in elastic-hardening plastic Mohr-Coulomb modele}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-4}
\end{figure}

Following Taylor's (1948) proposal of a link between dilatancy and mobilized friction in a shear box test, stress---dilatancy equation expressed in terms of total strain increments is obtained.

\subsection{Comparison between associated and non-associated flow rule in plastic model}\label{comparison-between-associated-and-non-associated-flow-rule-in-plastic-model}}

In the elastic-perfectly-plastic Mohr-Coulomb model, it is commonly assumed that the plastic potential takes the same form as the yield surface, but with the slope defined by a dilation angle \(\psi\) rather than a friction angle. If this assumption is adopted, then the dirction of the plastic strain increment \(\delta \varepsilon^{p}\) would be normal to a set of parallel lines by the dilation angle. If normality rule were assumed, radical difference between the slope of yield criterion line and the plastic potental contour is observed (J.P. Doherty and D. Muir Wood, 2013).

\phi_r' = \phi_r[1-\beta exp\{-(\frac{\chi}{\epsilon_d})^2\}]

\(E_{50}\) is a secant modulus defined as:\\
\(E_{50} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}q_{u}}{\varepsilon_{a,50}}\)\\

\end{figure}

Two tests --- Triaxial compression and extension (TC/TE) --- are simulated using Multiplier Elasto---plastic analysis under axisymmetric conditions as indicated in the Figure below.
The fixed loads here represent the initial axial and radial stresses while the axial Multiplier load is increased in the course of the analysis to reach the ultimate limit state.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{myfigureeeeee/setup for TC and TE} \caption{Setup for elemental triaxial compression and extension}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-10}
\end{figure}

By a process of trial and error, the fits shown in Figure are obtained. For this data set , where no information about the behavior in simple shear is available the value is well within range that can be accommodated by the isotropic strength option, there is little reason to assume any anisotropy.
We note that the compression secant modulus in compression is only half of the extension secant modulus. This is somewhat unusual, but in this case nevertheless what fits the data best.

Here is a table presenting the result of mesh convergence test on both NA and EMC models.\\
The goal of the mesh convergence test usually is to seek the acceptable range of number of the mesh size.
However, the interest in the present paper differs from the previously investigated objectives, in a way that the object sought is not the same.\\
The present paper seeks to draw a more detailed analysis of the failure surface formed as the soil is sheared.\\
Some authors in the past described this with the width of the shear band (Tanaka and Sakai, 1993). However, the present paper deals only with the limit analysis formulation using the Extended Mohr-Coulomb model.

The reulst of the present investigation is the determination of the number of the mesh elements be around 2000.\\
However, it is noted that further studies, outside of this paper, is onto the maximum number of the elements to be studied, for this will enhance the visualization of the shear band formation, as well as the guidance onto the study of the shear dissipation.

\subsection{Boundary Convergence}\label{boundary-convergence}}

The soil tank width and the distance below the anchor to the soil tank boundary are the primary condern for the modeling.\\
Therefore, the optimized value of the soil tank width has been investigated, by differing the values from 10B to 3B, , wherein B refers to the width of the anchor plate.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{myfigureeeeee/boundary} \caption{Convergence test setup on different boundary size: (a) 10B, (b) 7B, (c) 5B, (d) 3B}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-19}
\end{figure}

Due to the reasoning which considers the method of mesh adaptivity, insignificant effect onto the extension of the soil tank width has been deemed acceptable by the author. Therefore, the result of the boundary convergence test is determined at 10B.

The goal is to find the best matching load---displacement curve by comparing the measurements with the models: EMC and NA.\\
In order to find the suitable pair of a set of variables, the values were varied by interpolating those in between the dense and the loose sands of the representative values from the example file provided by the software. The result is that for the EMC model, the set named B and C show a good match, whereas for the NA model, the set with H and G display a favorable fit. The chosen set of parameters are presented in the tables below:

The following load---displacement curves were generated by varying not only the codes but also the model parameters. The data from total number of 80 simulations were accumulated to draw 8 plots with base numbers from 2 to 8, which represent the variation of the size of the footing width. In the plot below, the line with markers represent the NA model, whereas only those of the colored lines are the EMC models. It is noted that among 80 load---displacement curves, only 4 were selected for matching the dense and loose sand cases of the centrifuge test results.

To evaluate the difference between the centrifuge test result and the model prediction, residual error was used:

\[
Error = \lvert \frac{y_{actual}-y_{estimated}}{y_{actual}}\lvert \times 100\% 
\]
The goal is to find the model which best fits (or has the least error) the measured data.
For the dense sand cases, Model C and H, whereas for the loose sand cases, Model B and G were chosen for the further studies.

Dimensionless uplift capacity factor can be defined as the ratio of the ultimate uplift capacity to the soil encapsulated above the plate which lay inside the failure surface.

\[
N_q = \frac{Q_u}{\gamma AD}
\]
